      <h1>How Eratosthenes Measured Earth's Circumference</h1>

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          Around 240 BCE, Eratosthenes, a Greek mathematician and the chief
          librarian at the Library of Alexandria, made one of the most
          remarkable measurements in ancient science—he calculated the
          circumference of the Earth with surprising accuracy using just simple
          observations and geometry.
        </p>
        <div class="info-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Key observation:</strong> Eratosthenes noticed that at noon
            on the summer solstice, the Sun cast no shadow in Syene (modern-day
            Aswan, Egypt), while in Alexandria, about 800 km to the north, it
            cast a measurable shadow.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>The Experiment</h2>
        <div class="flex-container">
          <div class="flex-item">
            <p>Eratosthenes' experiment relied on two critical observations:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                At noon on the summer solstice in Syene, the Sun's rays shone
                directly down a deep well, casting no shadow—meaning the Sun was
                directly overhead.
              </li>
              <li>
                At the same time in Alexandria, a vertical stick cast a shadow,
                indicating the Sun was not directly overhead.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              By measuring the angle of the shadow in Alexandria (about 7.2°),
              Eratosthenes determined this was the same angle subtended at the
              center of the Earth between Alexandria and Syene.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="flex-item">
            <div class="info-box">
              <p>
                <strong>The insight:</strong> Since 7.2° is approximately 1/50
                of a full circle (360°), the distance between Alexandria and
                Syene (about 800 kilometers or 5,000 stadia) must be 1/50 of
                Earth's total circumference!

        <h2>The Calculation</h2>
        <div class="interactive">
          <p>Eratosthenes used the following logic:</p>
          <div class="calculation">
            <p>
              If the shadow angle is <span id="shadowAngle">7.2</span>° and this
              represents the angle between the two cities as seen from Earth's
              center...

            <p>
              And the distance between cities is
              <span id="cityDistance">5000</span> stadia...
            </p>
            <p>
              Then Earth's circumference =
              <span id="cityDistance2">5000</span> stadia × (360° ÷
              <span id="shadowAngle2">7.2</span>°)

            <p>
              Earth's circumference =
              <span id="earthCircumference">250,000</span> stadia (about 40,000

        <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
        <p>
          Eratosthenes' calculation gave a circumference of about 250,000
          stadia, which is remarkably close to the modern value of about 40,000
          km (depending on which ancient stadion length is used for conversion).
        </p>
        <p>
          This experiment, conducted over 2,200 years ago with simple tools,
          demonstrates how careful observation and mathematical reasoning can
          reveal fundamental truths about our world.
        </p>
        <div class="info-box">
          <p>
            <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Eratosthenes didn't need to travel
            between the two cities himself. He learned about the no-shadow
            phenomenon in Syene from records and measured the shadow in
            Alexandria where he lived.
